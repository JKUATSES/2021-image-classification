Repository to learn image classification
## Introduction - A brief on Image Classification
Image classification is pattern recognition in image data using algorithms. Two methods maybe used:
* Deep learning - uses convolution neural networks to progressively extract higher- and higher-level representations of the image content
  The CNN comprises a stack of modules, each of which performs three operations.
  1. Convolution -extracts tiles of the input feature map, and applies filters to them to compute new features, producing an output feature map, or convolved feature (which may have   a different size and depth than the input feature map). Convolutions are defined by two parameters:
      *Size of the tiles that are extracted (typically 3x3 or 5x5 pixels).
      *The depth of the output feature map, which corresponds to the number of filters that are applied.
  2. Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)- the CNN applies a  transformation to the convolved feature following each convolution operation, in order to introduce nonlinearity into the model
  3. Pooling - the CNN downsamples the convolved feature (to save on processing time), reducing the number of dimensions of the feature map, while still preserving the most critical feature information. A common algorithm used for this process is called max pooling.
* Transfer learning using pre-trained models
In this image classification both methods were used comparitively and transfer learning had way better performance.

## Dataset 
The data used for this project was obtained from a [Zindi challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/runmila-ai-institute-minohealth-ai-labs-tuberculosis-classification-via-x-rays-challenge/data). The data have been split into a test and training set. The training set, on which you will train your models, contains 353 images of x-rays of TB-positive lungs and 365 images of x-rays of healthy lungs. The test set contains 82 images.
### Disclaimer

This challenge is solely for educational purposes. Chest X-Rays is one of various tools that can be used for triaging and screening for Tuberculosis. Furthermore, it is possible for an individual to develop different types of infections. This is to be treated purely as an exercise in tool development.
