In South Africa Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death with 450,000 people developing the disease every year and 89,000 people dying from it. That’s ten people every hour.\n",

In countries with a high prevalence level of TB, TB can create additional complexity to the COVID-19 response. And by the same token, COVID-19 is adding new complexity to the ongoing battle against TB.\n",

With Tuberculosis infections still active as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, an automated tool to help identify TB has the potential to reduce hospital workload and optimize patient care during a time when hospitals are being overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases.\n"
